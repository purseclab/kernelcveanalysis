# Bug
In some cases deleting an element from an `nft_set` does not mark it as busy for the GC. If GC is configured to run at a set interval, it will delete element again. This exploit uses a set element referencing an `nft_chain` to free the chain by decrementing recount too much.

# Exploit Chain (lts)
Kind of similar to [[CVE-2023-3777 (lts)]], just different methodology to get rip control, and using jop instead of rop.
