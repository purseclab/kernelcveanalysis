# Bug
In a transaction, it is possible to use an immediate expression referencing a bound chain to decrease its reference count twice. Evantually this can lead to UAF of nft_chain

TODO: better understand this

# Exploit Chain (lts)
Uses a similar methodology to [[CVE-2023-3777 (lts)]].
The only difference is we must have an additional immediate expr referencing the double freed chain, so the remaining link to the freed chain comes from immediate expr, not the table when leaking kaslr base and heap.
