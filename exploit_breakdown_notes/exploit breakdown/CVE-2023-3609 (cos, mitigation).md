# Bug
Uaf on drr qdisc class.
Bug is almost the same as [[CVE-2023-4206 (lts, cos)]], just with a different way to manipulate qdisc reference count. If invalid parameters are sent to the u32 classifier, it will prematurely increment or decrement refcount then return.

# Exploit Chain (lts)
Identical to [[CVE-2023-4206 (lts, cos)]], just using different trigger to get same uaf.

# Exploit Chain (mitigation)
