This is a table overview of some properties of each exploit.

# Table Columns
### Exploit Families
Exploit family is noting which exploits are very similar in structure and likely copied the same format and code.

##### UAF on Qdisc into eBPF shellcode
Basically [[CVE-2023-4206 (lts, cos)]], initial bug might be slightly different.

### Code Execution Method
Code execution method is for example, rop, jop with rop, the eBPF jit shellcode technique, etc

### Privilege Escalation Technique
Privilege Escalation Technique is what the final thing the exploit does to gain privileges is.
This is usually either `commit_creds(init_creds())` (set process to root) or overwrite `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` to control crash dump program.

### KASLR Leak Method
KASLR leak method is like, how it leaked a pointer, or did it use the sidechannel.
