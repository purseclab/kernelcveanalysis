This is a table overview of some properties of each exploit.

Notes:
Exploit family is noting which exploits are very similar in structure and likely copied the same format and code.

Code execution method is for example, rop, jop with rop, the eBPF jit shellcode technique, etc

Privilege Escalation Technique is what the final thing the exploit does to gain privileges is.
This is usually either `commit_creds(init_creds())` (set process to root) or overwrite `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` to control crash dump program.

KASLR leak method is like, how it leaked a pointer, or did it use the sidechannel.
