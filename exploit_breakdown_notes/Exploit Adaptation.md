# What Needs to be Adapted

## Offsets In Binary

## Offsets in Struct

## Characteristics of Kernel Linear Mapping
For example physical load address randomization, if you have pipe buffer arb physical read write (ie. in badspin)
TODO: determine what can change

## Kmalloc Cache Object is From
Some objects may have their size changed, and move to different cache

More commonly, object is moved to a different cache of the same size, either specifically for that object, or from kmallocN to kmallocN-cg
This affects if cross cache attack is needed or not

# Kexploit Tests
- Badnode
	- Auto annotate: ✅
	- Adapt:
		- reference kernel -> ingots 5.10.101: ✅
- CVE-2023-4244-lts
	- Auto annotate: ⚠️
		- Several offsets are written as sum of random numbers which tool cannot handle
	- Adapt:
		- kernelctf_6.1.36_lts -> kernelctf_6.1.52_lts: ✅
			- Although it fails to adapt one offset, the exploit still works (offset seems to just be pointing to unused writable memory for ROP chain to write stuff to)
- CVE-2024-53141-lts
	- Auto annotate: ⚠️
		- An extra field called START_ROP which is not supposed to be adapted is marked as a rop gadget
