# What Needs to be Adapted

## Offsets In Binary

## Offsets in Struct

## Characteristics of Kernel Linear Mapping
For example physical load address randomization, if you have pipe buffer arb physical read write (ie. in badspin)
TODO: determine what can change

## Kmalloc Cache Object is From
Some objects may have their size changed, and move to different cache

More commonly, object is moved to a different cache of the same size, either specifically for that object, or from kmallocN to kmallocN-cg
This affects if cross cache attack is needed or not

## Kernel Architecture

## Accessible APIs
