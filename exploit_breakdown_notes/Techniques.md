### Common Objects to Spray

- `msg_msg` and `msg_seg`
	- message queue messages, variable size and lots of bytes controllable, except first few bytes
- key using add_key syscall
	- `user_key_payload`
- signalfd
	- first 8 byte are controllable unlike `msg_msg`
- pip buffer
- `simple_xattr`
- `poll_list`
- `tty_write_buffer`
	- write data to opened fd from `/dev/ptmx`
	- Controlled data in kmalloc-1k

### Notes About Caches
Newer kernel put `msg_msg` in there own cache group
If `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT` is specified instead of `GFP_KERNEL`, object go into `kmalloc-cg-*` cache instead of `kmalloc-*` cache. (`GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT` is used for tracking memory usage for cgroups)
Some kernel don't have separate `kmalloc-cg-*` cache

Notable caches
- `filp_cache`: used for `struct file`
- `cred_jar`: used for `struct cred`
