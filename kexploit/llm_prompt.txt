Version 1:
I have some C code which exploits a vulnerability in the linux kernel. It depends on addresses in the linux kernel to work. Could you find all these addresses, and pass them into the function __kexploit_kernel_address? For example, #define ADDR 0xffffffc010020f58 becomes #define ADDR __kexploit_kernel_address(0xffffffc010020f58). The code is shown below:

Version 2:
I have some C code which exploits a vulnerability in the linux kernel. It depends on addresses in the linux kernel to work. Could you find all these addresses, and return JSON data which specifies the line number (starting from 1), column number (starting from 1), and value of the address?

For example, for the given code:
```
#define A 0xffffffc010020f58
#define B 123

int main() {
    size_t c = 0xffffffc092004cd0
}
```

The corresponding JSON data is:
```
[
    {
        "address": "0xffffffc010020f58",
        "line": 1,
        "column": 11
    },
    {
        "address": "0xffffffc092004cd0",
        "line": 5,
        "column": 16
    }
]
```

The code for wich I want you to compute this JSON data is given below:
```

Version 3 (output json containint address value only):
I have some C code which exploits a vulnerability in the linux kernel. It depends on addresses in the linux kernel to work.
Could you find all these addresses, and output JSON data containing a list of these addresses?
For example, for the given code:
```
#define A 0xffffffc010020f58
#define B 123

int main() {
    size_t c = 0xffffffc092004cd0
}
```

The corresponding JSON data is:
```
[
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc010020f58"
    },
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc092004cd0"
    }
]
```

The code for wich I want you to compute this JSON data is given below:
File <file_name>:
```
```

Version 4 (output only json):
I have some C code which exploits a vulnerability in the linux kernel. It depends on addresses in the linux kernel to work.
Could you find all these addresses, and output JSON data containing a list of these addresses?
For example, for the given code:
```
#define A 0xffffffc010020f58
#define B 123

int main() {
    size_t c = 0xffffffc092004cd0
}
```

The corresponding JSON data is:
```
[
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc010020f58"
    },
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc092004cd0"
    }
]
```

The code for wich I want you to compute this JSON data is given below:
File <file_name>:
```
```

Output only the JSON data, and nothing else.

Version 5 (output offsets and address) (llm also reports struct offsets as offset):
I have some C code which exploits a vulnerability in the linux kernel. It depends on addresses and offsets in the linux kernel to work.
Could you find all these addresses, and output JSON data containing a list of these addresses and offsets?
For example, for the given code:
```
#define A 0xffffffc010020f58
#define B 123

int main() {
    size_t c = 0xffffffc092004cd0;
    size_t d_offset = 0x34980;
}
```

The corresponding JSON data is:
```
[
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc010020f58"
    },
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc092004cd0"
    },
    {
        "type": "offset",
        "value": "0x34980"
    }
]
```

The code for wich I want you to compute this JSON data is given below:
File <file_name>:
```
```

Output only the JSON data, and nothing else.

Version 6 (output offsets, struct offsets, and address):
I have some C code which exploits a vulnerability in the linux kernel. It depends on addresses, offsets, and struct field offsets in the linux kernel to work.
Could you find all these addresses, and output JSON data containing a list of these addresses, offsets, and struct field offsets?

Addresses are 64 bit absolute virtual kernel addresses, typically with many leading 0xffffff bits, and have a type of `address`.
Offsets are offsets relative to the base of the kernel executable, and have a type of `offset`.
Struct field offsets are the offset from the start of a struct to a field in the struct. They are typically much smaller then offsets relative to the kernel base, typically less than 2048.
Struct field offsets have a type of `struct_offset`.

For example, for the given code:
```
#define A 0xffffffc010020f58
#define B_OFFSET 0x120

int main() {
    size_t c = 0xffffffc092004cd0;
    size_t d_offset = 0x34980;
}
```

The corresponding JSON data is:
```
[
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc010020f58"
    },
    {
        "type": "struct_offset",
        "value": "0x120"
    },
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc092004cd0"
    },
    {
        "type": "offset",
        "value": "0x34980"
    }
]
```

The code for which I want you to compute this JSON data is given below:
File <file_name>:
```
```

Output only the JSON data, and nothing else.

Version 7 (output offsets, struct offsets, and address):

Struct field offsets are the offset from the start of a struct to a field in the struct. They are typically much smaller then offsets relative to the kernel base, typically less than 2048.
Struct field offsets have a type of `struct_offset`.

Report addresses and offsets exactly as they appear in the code. Don't try to compute offsets from the addresses present in the code, just report the address constants in the JSON data.

For example, for the given code:
```
#define A 0xffffffc010020f58
#define B_OFFSET 0x120

int main() {
    size_t c = 0xffffffc092004cd0;
    size_t d_offset = 0x34980;
    size_t z_offset = A - 0xffffffc088084000;
}
```

The corresponding JSON data is:
```
[
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc010020f58"
    },
    {
        "type": "struct_offset",
        "value": "0x120"
    },
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc092004cd0"
    },
    {
        "type": "offset",
        "value": "0x34980"
    },
    {
        "type": "address",
        "value": "0xffffffc088084000"
    }
]
```
