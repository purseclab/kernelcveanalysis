# Kexploit

Tool for automatic exploit adaptation between linux kernels.

## Setup

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) python package / project manager to run.

Other tools are needed for certain functionality:
- [vmlinux-to-elf](https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf) for loading kernel images for exploit adaptation
- [android-ndk](https://github.com/purseclab/kernelcveanalysis/blob/main/exploit_breakdown_notes/Installing%20Android%20NDK.md) for compiling syzkall POCs to test on cuttlefish
  - You will also need to update `./compile.sh` file to point to android-ndk installation folder
- `syz-prog2c` binary from [syzkaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller) to translate syz DSL pocs to C pocs for running on cuttlefish
  - place `syz-prog2c` binary in same current working directory you run kexploit in
- [ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) for analyzing kernels and adapting exploits between kernels
  - Point `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` env variable to folder containing ghidra release downloaded from github (can be done in .env file)
- [gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) for decrompressing downloaded kernelCTF kernel images
- [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) for testing adapted exploits against kernels in a VM

### .env file

Certain environmant variables are needed fro certain functionallity, and they can be put in a .env file.

Example .env:

```
# OpenAI api key for automatic exploit annotation
OPENAI_API_KEY="REDACTED"
# Folder to store all kexploit data (syzkall artifacts, kernel binaries, ghidra data, etc) in
KEXPLOIT_DATA_DIR="/home/jack/Documents/college/purdue/research/kernelcveanalysis/kexploit/kexploit_data/"
# Folder containing ghidra release for exploit adaptation
GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR="/home/jack/Documents/college/purdue/research/kernelcveanalysis/kexploit/ghidra_11.3.2_PUBLIC/"
```

### Docker

Alternatively, you can run kexploit in a docker container. The Dockerfile is provided in the repository. We also provide a script to run everything once the docker container is built.
To build the docker image, run:
```sh
docker build -t kexploit-env .
```
To run the docker container, you can use the provided script:
```sh
./set-env
```
This will mount the current `kexploit` directory to `/workspace/kexploit` in the container, match the network to the host network, and then also run it in user mode so all of the data collected can be accessed from the host machine.

### Setup for Running syzkaller POCs on Cuttlefish

Start the cuttlefish emulator on cuttlefish server, and run adb once to start adb daemon:
```sh
cd /home/jack/cuttlefish_images/aosp_android13_cgi/cf
HOME=$PWD ./bin/launch_cvd -kernel_path=/home/jack/ingots/kernel/Image -initramfs_path=/home/jack/ingots/kernel/initramfs.img
./bin/adb shell
```
The above command starts ingots kernel 5.10.101, but there are many different kernel versions on cuttlefish server.

Setup ssh port forwarding for adb on local machine running kexploit:
```sh
ssh -L localhost:5037:localhost:5037 cuttlefish-user@cuttlefish-host
```

`uv run kexploit test <bug_id>` can now be used to test syzkaller bugs.

## Running

In the kexploit folder, run `uv run kexploit` to run kexploit. There are various commands and subcommands that can be run (see `uv run kexploit --help` or `src/kexploit/main.py` for details).

### Kexploit Subcommands

#### Exploit Adaptation
- `uv run kexploit kernel list`: list imported kernels
- `uv run kexploit kernel add --name imported_kernel_name path/to/kernel/image`: import kernel image for exploit adaptation (may take a long time, around 10-15 minutes)
- `uv run kexploit annotate --kernel kernel_name exploit_file1.c exploit_file2.c`: automatically annotate exploit files
- `uv run kexploit adapt --old-kernel kernel_name --new-kernel kernel_name exploit_file1.c exploit_file2.c`: adapt annotated exploit from 1 kernel version to another

#### Syzkaller POC Reproduction
- `uv run kexploit syzkall pull`: pull exploits from syzkaller website and save locally
  - database with syzkall exploits metadata already created and pushed in github so this shouldn't be needed
- `uv run kexploit syzkall query`: query available POCs pulled from syzkaller website
  - kind of incomplete, I just wrote random code here and changed code itself when looking for different bugs
- `uv run kexploit syzkall test <bug_id>`: run the given bug on cuttlefish and reprot if crash occurred
  - see [here](#setup-for-running-syzkaller-pocs-on-cuttlefish) for neccessary setup for `kexploit test`
- `uv run kexploit syzkall testall`: run all available syzkaller POCs on cuttlefish and report if crash occurred
  - this will take a long time, so be careful with this command and make sure the connection isn't disconnected otherwise you may need to restart the port forwarding and adb daemon

There are also extensions for all of the commands above to allow for you to specify the kernel version you want to pull from and use for testing. The default version is `android-5.10`, but you can specify any kernel version that is available in the syzbot database.
For example, if you want to run against the current upstream kernel, you can use:
```sh
uv run kexploit syzkall pull --syzkall-kernel upstream
uv run kexploit syzkall testall --syzkall-kernel upstream
```

### Example
On the host machine:
```sh
ssh -L localhost:5037:localhost:5037 cuttlefish-user@cuttlefish-host
cd ~/ingots2/U-2.1.TA1
./run.sh
```

In a seperate terminal on the host machine:
```sh
docker build -t kexploit-env .
./set-env
cd /workspace/kexploit
uv run kexploit syzkall pull
uv run kexploit syzkall testall
```
Note: The docker container can only be run on x86 machines as of right now


## Type Checking
