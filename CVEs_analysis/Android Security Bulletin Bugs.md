- DNS UAF not viable ATM I think?
	- Need to do more investigating
	- It is in component which handles ipv4 <-> ipv6 dns translation stuff or something
	- Comment mentions it is only started when there are only ipv6 nameservers detected
		- Couldn't verify, since the code paths that cause it to be started are all aidl binder calls
		- IDnsResolver which has the startPrefix64Discover which triggers buggy codepath, is not accessible on binder interface to unprivileged process
