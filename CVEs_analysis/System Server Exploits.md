Exploitation possible above android 11, slightly more involved:

https://gist.github.com/rabits/ecae96c256cb25726b2bb92c73f9c081

- Successfully exploited on android 12
	- luanched netcat listener

Requires `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`, which is quite privileged
# Parcel Bugs
It seems many bugs are possible with android serialization method used. It seems if there is mismatch in serialize vs deserialize length issue,
later data is messed up, so there can be a confused system server which sees data different then another one it forwards it on to.

# Parcel Use After Recycle
https://github.com/michalbednarski/LeakValue

Through some bugs, it is possible to recycle a parcel with sensitive binder handles, then trick system server into sending it back to process

Requires permissions:
- android.permission.KILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES
- android.permission.REORDER_TASKS

And specific service declarations in manifest file

# Reparcel2
https://github.com/michalbednarski/ReparcelBug2
No special permissions required, but unfortunately patched in betas of android 12.

# Parcel Mismatch
CVE-2024-49721: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/7714ccb85ed961083dcc97e230c71242c3422b5e

# Other Parcel Issue
https://github.com/jiayy/android_vuln_poc-exp/blob/master/android/CVE-2023-45777/README.md
Uses samsung specific class, also works on newer hardware

# CVE-2022-22292 (start arbitrary intent)
https://www.quokka.io/blog/start-arbitrary-activity-app-components-as-the-system-user-vulnerability-affecting-samsung-android-devices
Only affects samsung devices, very old (just for info about possible things to do with intents)

# badparcel

fix commit: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/266b3bddcf14d448c0972db64b42950f76c759e3
uses technique: https://pwnipc.github.io/posts/bundle-fengshui-android-s-self-changing-bundle/

tested to work on android 12, unsure how to proceed with privilege escalation
it seems we have ability for settings to start arbitrary intent

Requires a specific service defined in the manifest to work

# run-as debug any app
run-as can only be invoked from adb shell, not super useful in real wolrd.
https://rtx.meta.security/exploitation/2024/03/04/Android-run-as-forgery.html

Also requires permissions to install app

# DNS UAF

Probably not useful
