# Exploitation technique

To my knowledge, the following exploitation techniques are not known/publicly-documented:

## Leverage `struct netlink_sock` to get arbitrarily read/write primitive
- This technique is used in mitigation exploit.

### Advantages
- Do not need to setup network user namespace.
- Can read large bytes from specify address.
- Live in less noisy heap. Therefore, free the current fake `struct netlink_sock` object and reclaim with new address to read from or write to is very stable.
- Can be used to perform data only attack.

### Disadvantages
- Cannot read from invalid memory address.
- Can only write 4 bytes per fake `struct netlink_sock` object.
- Only allocate on kmalloc-2048 (dyn-kmalloc-2048 in mitigation instace).
- In case Apparmor is enabled, `sk-security` need to be valid pointer.

## Leverage `struct packet_fanout` to get arbitrarily free primitive
- This technique is used in mitigation exploit.

### Advantages
- Can be allocate on kmalloc-256 -> kmalloc-8192 (dyn-kmalloc-256 -> dyn-kmalloc-8192 in mitigation instance).

### Disadvantages
- Require CAP_NET_RAW to create packet socket.
- Need to setup data look like `struct packet_fanout` object in the free location. Let's call this location: A1.
- Need to control at least one `struct packet_fanout` object linked list. This fake linked list will be used to reach A1.

## Overlap `struct user_key_payload` object with `struct packet_fanout` object
- This technique is used in mitigation exploit.

```c
struct packet_fanout {
	possible_net_t		net;
	unsigned int		num_members;
	u32			max_num_members;
	u16			id;
	u8			type;
	u8			flags;
	union {
		atomic_t		rr_cur;
		struct bpf_prog __rcu	*bpf_prog;
	};
	struct list_head	list;
	spinlock_t		lock;
	refcount_t		sk_ref;
	struct packet_type	prot_hook ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp;
	struct sock	__rcu	*arr[];
};
```

```c
struct packet_type {
	__be16			type;	/* This is really htons(ether_type). */
	bool			ignore_outgoing;
	struct net_device	*dev;	/* NULL is wildcarded here	     */
	netdevice_tracker	dev_tracker;
	int			(*func) (struct sk_buff *,
					 struct net_device *,
					 struct packet_type *,
					 struct net_device *);
	void			(*list_func) (struct list_head *,
					      struct packet_type *,
					      struct net_device *);
	bool			(*id_match)(struct packet_type *ptype,
					    struct sock *sk);
	struct net		*af_packet_net;
	void			*af_packet_priv;
	struct list_head	list;
};
```

```c
static LIST_HEAD(fanout_list);
```

- Let's call the overlapped `struct packet_fanout`: pf.

### Advantages
- Can be overlapped in kmalloc-256 -> kmalloc-8192 (dyn-kmalloc-256 -> dyn-kmalloc-8192 in mitigation instace).
- Read "in object" heap only. This make the leak 100% success. Especially useful on mitigation instance where reading out-of-slab data lead to kernel crash.
- Each new allocated `struct packet_fanout` is inserted at the head of `fanout_list`. Therefore, read `pf->list.prev` will allow to leak heap address from kmalloc-256 -> kmalloc-8192 (dyn-kmalloc-256 -> dyn-kmalloc-8192 in mitigation instance).
- Read `pf->prot_hook.func` will give us address of `packet_rcv_fanout` kernel function. This can be used to calculate kernel base.
- Read `pf->prot_hook.id_match` will give us address of `match_fanout_group` kernel function. This can be used to calculate kernel base.
- Read `pf->prot_hook.af_packet_priv` will give us address of our overlapped `struct packet_fanout` object that we are currenly using.
- Read `pf->prot_hook.af_packet_net` will give us address of current `net` namespace.

### Disadvantages
- Require CAP_NET_RAW to create packet socket.
- Require specific primitive to make the overlap happen.

## Leverage `struct ovl_dir_file` to get code execution
- This technique is used in LTS instance.

### Advantages
- Need to control only `is_real` field and `realfile` field.
- When trigger code execution through lseek, RBP register set to `offset` value passed into lseek. Usually, we can find gadget like: `mov rsp, rbp; pop rbp; ret`.

### Disadvantages
- Require CAP_SYS_ADMIN to mount overlayfs.
- Allocate only on kmalloc-64.
- Need a place to store fake `struct file_operations` object with `lseek` pointer set to gadget address
- Need a place to store fake `struct file` object with `f_op` pointer set to fake `struct file_operations` object.
