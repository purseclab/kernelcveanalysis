### Build info

We have a C program that builds a GIF file to exploit the vulnerability.
The GIF file is then pushed to an Android device using ADB.

### Run Info

To run the exploit, you need to have the Android device connected and setup the app.
Then you need to open the GIF file in the app to trigger the exploit.

Currently, due to exploit limitations the command executed is only a log command.
We believe that with a better gadget we might be able to execute larger arbitrary commands.
The addresses of the libraries are also hardcoded in the script, we need another primitve or information disclosure to make it work better.
