This is a chrome sandbox escape based on [this](https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/0day-RCAs/2020/CVE-2020-16010.html) project zero post. There is an exsiting poc to cause a chrash in chromium included with the [original post](https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/42451222) about this issue. 

To use this poc, apply [patch.diff](patch.diff) to a vulnerable version of chrome before building and it should cause a crash on launch. More work is needed to apply this poc as a part of a chain with one of the renderer exploits.
