This repository presents the results of our research on Linux and Android exploitation.

As part of this work, we studied and/or developed multiple vulnerabilities, which were used to construct a **Vulnerability Knowledge Base (VKB)**.

- A lightweight version of the VKB (excluding PoC source code) is available in: `vulnerabilities_nopocs.db`.

- The full version of the VKB, including the source code for proof-of-concept exploits, can be downloaded here: [vulnerabilities.db](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/antoniob/shared/vulnerabilities.db).
