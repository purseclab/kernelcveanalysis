# Primitives

This package contains exploit primitives for Linux kernel research.

Each primitive is stored in a directory within `src/primitive_data/` (or a custom path) and contains:
- `metadata.json`: Metadata about the primitive.
- `PRIMITIVE.md`: Documentation on how to use the primitive.
- `primitive.c`: C code implementing the primitive.
